Compiling SmartPalm from Sources on a Linux box.


Using instructions from:
    http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/
    http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/rpm.html

I did this: 

As root:
--------
Install prc-tools-2.3-1.i386.rpm
Install palmos-sdk-4.0-1.noarch.rpm (from sdk40.tar.gz)
Install pilrc-3.2-1.i386.rpm
Run "palmdev-prep" 

As a normal user:
-----------------
cd SmartPalm/main
make

The last resulted in a file called "SmartPalm.prc" being created.
This is the compiled executable.
