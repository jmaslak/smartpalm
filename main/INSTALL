Compiling SmartPalm from Sources on a Linux box.


Using instructions from:
    http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/
    http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/rpm.html

I did this: 

As root:
--------
Install prc-tools-2.3-1.i386.rpm
Install palmos-sdk-4.0-1.noarch.rpm (from sdk40.tar.gz)
Install pilrc-3.2-1.i386.rpm
Install pose-3.5-2.i386.rpm
Install pose-perl-3.5-2.i386.rpm
Install pose-skins-handspring-3.1H4-1.noarch.rpm
Install pose-skins-1.9-1.noarch.rpm
Download/Unzip PalmOS412_DbgROMs.zip (must register to get this)
Download/Unzip PalmOS412_RelROMs.zip (must register to get this)
Run "palmdev-prep" 

As a normal user:
-----------------
cd SmartPalm/main
make

The last resulted in a file called "SmartPalm.prc" being created.
This is the compiled executable for SmartPalm.

Start the emulator by typing "pose &".

Right-click on the window that comes up, select "New".  Select a ROM
file, Device, Skin, and RAM size.  A Palm device picture will come
up.

Select Install Application/Database and install SmartPalm.prc

Once that completes you can start "APRS" in the pose emulator just
as if you were running it on a real PalmOS device.
